# TypeScript Select and Share

A select and share places app built using the Google Maps API and TypeScript, as part of Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's [Udemy course](http://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript).

Add your own Google Maps API key to app.ts and index.html, and then run 'tsc' in order to use the app.
